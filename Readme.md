# Intelligent Systems - Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Intelligent Systems Diabetes Prediction Project! This project serves as the culmination of the first course in Intelligent Systems, aimed at leveraging machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient has diabetes. The primary focus lies in developing various classifiers utilizing the scikit-learn framework.

## Project Objectives

- Develop and compare different classifiers using the scikit-learn framework.
- Predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data.
- Provide step-by-step explanations of the implemented algorithms to enhance understanding and facilitate future implementations.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset sourced from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases. This dataset comprises healthcare statistics and lifestyle survey information from a diverse sample of 253,680 individuals.

Feel free to explore the project, delve into the codebase, and contribute to advancing our understanding of diabetes prediction using intelligent systems!
